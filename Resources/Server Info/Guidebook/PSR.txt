    PSR J0952–0607 is a binary millisecond pulsar, located within the Sol constellation Sextans. It is the most massive neutron star currently known, and functions as a very large warp trap within it's local region, restricting the ability to colonize systems within 20 light-years of it's location due to the interference.

    There are a number of interstellar debris fields collectively known as the J0952 graveyards, within which approximately 132 known interstellar carrier vessels have been trapped.
