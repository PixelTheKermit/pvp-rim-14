    It is generally wise to avoid situations that will cause you harm, as the general lack of immediate health-care renders even less dangerous situations potentially deadly.

    Your PDA contains both a vessel name and list of crew currently active in your vessel, a reminder for your name if needed, and your assigned job for the shift, allowing you to quickly assess the situation.

[color=#ffd700]# Emergency Treatment[/color]

    In the event of a serious emergency, there's a few things you can do to help ensure your long-term survival, including:

    › If actively bleeding out, or simply withing to prepare, it's possible to slice up cloth items with a knife or other sharp object and use the resulting cloth to create gauze to stem bleeding with.
    › If going blind, carrots are a much easier way to treat the issue than chemistry should they be available.
    › Well-made meals (cooked food not from a vending machine) is generally much better for your overall health and can help heal smaller wounds more quickly.
    › Simple bed rest cures the majority of diseases and also allows wounds to close up on their own. Medical beds are best for this, providing a sterile surface and support for all damaged body parts, but any bed works. Simply sitting down also helps, albeit significantly less.
