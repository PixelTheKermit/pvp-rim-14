Your core toolset is a small variety of tools. If you're an engineer, then you should have a belt on your waist containing one of each, if not you can likely find them in maintenance and tool storage within assorted toolboxes and vending machines.

Most tasks will have explainers for how to perform them on examination, for example if you're constructing a wall, it'll tell you the next step if you look at it a bit closer.
