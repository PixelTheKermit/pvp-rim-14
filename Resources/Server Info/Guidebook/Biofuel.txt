#Fuel
Biofuel generators are equipped with a simple reprocesser to convert foodstuff into burnable fuels [color=#a4885c]according to it's nutritional value[/color]. Some biological matter, namely that with no nutritional value, cannot be reprocessed this way for the time being.

Additionally if you were to obtain a biomass processor, biomass is a valid fuel source for these generators and is the most effective one available.
